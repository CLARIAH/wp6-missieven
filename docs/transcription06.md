# Source format

The source data for the TF conversion is in 
[TEI format](https://tei-c.org).

The version number of the TEI set is used in the
[tfFromTrim](https://github.com/Dans-labs/clariah-gm/blob/master/programs/tfFromTrim.py)
conversion.

We have created several TF data versions out of a single source version.
The TF-app `clariah/wp6-missieven` states the TEI source version and TF version used in its metadata
in its
[config.yaml](https://github.com/clariah/wp6-missieven/blob/master/app/config.yaml)

The TEI source has been cleaned and the result is captured in a set of simplified, TEI-like XML files,
in this repo.
For an overview of the element usage in those files, see
[elementsOut.tsv](https://github.com/clariah/wp6-missieven/blob/master/trimreport3/elementsOut.tsv).

Here is a short explanation

element | description
--- | ---
`teiTrim` | top-level element
`header` | container of meta elements and meta elements only
`meta` | a key-value pair of meta data (empty, attribute key names the key, value in attribute value)
`head` | the heading of a letter, 1 heading per letter
`subhead` | headings within a letter
`remark` | container of editorial content (the italic bits between brackets)
`lb` | line break element (empty, no attributes)
`pb` | page break element (empty, with attributes for volume number, page number, facsimile references)
`para` | paragraph
`table`, row, cell | tabular structure of text
`ref` | something that looks like a reference to other literature
`emph` | italic text
`und` | underlined text
`sub` | subscript text
`super` | superscript text
`special` | text with special typography for whatever reason
`fref`, `fnote` | footnote marks and bodies, with `ref` attribute containing the footnote number
`folio` | reference to original folio

This XML has been converted rather straightforwardly into Text-Fabric, which is a graph of annotated
nodes.

## Metadata

We have compared the given metadata with metadata we distil from the letter heads and resolved
all disagreements.

A complete account is in 
[metaDiagnostics.txt](https://github.com/Dans-labs/clariah-gm/blob/master/trimreport2/metaDiagnostics.txt).


## Text

The running, unmarked text is original letter text, written between 1610 and 1761

The italic paragraphs, usually but not always between brackets, are editorial comments,
written between 1960 and 2007.

### Footnotes

Both types of text are annotated with footnotes.

There are two kind of footnotes: 

1. original footnotes, marked by `a`, `b`. 
2. editorial footnotes, marked by `1`, `2`, ...

There are very few original footnotes, less than a handful.
There are over 12,000 editorial footnotes.

This dataset does not make the distinction between original footnotes and editorial footnotes.

There is some complexity in the footnote numbering:

1. sometimes the numbering skips a position
2. in the lower volumes, the numbering is by page, in the higher volumes by letter
3. a footnote text can be referenced by multiple footnote reference with the same number

In the case of multiple references, we have duplicated the footnote text into as many copies,
so that we can maintain a 1-1 correspondence between references and footnotes.
In such cases, we have adapted the numbering.

In the dataset, the footnote numbers are not important any more, because the footnote bodies
have become features that annotate the words where the corresponding footnote marks occur.
Yet we have retained the footnote number in the footnote body.
Because of the remapping of multiple references, the footnote number you see in the dataset may be
one or more off w.r.t. the footnote number you see in the original.

If there are multiple footnotes to the same word, we concatenate
the material of the footnotes (including their marks), separated by a double newline.

## Nodes

The basic node type (*slot* type) is the word.

There are also node types for other entities, such as volume, letter, page, line,
as listed in the `otype` feature and documented below.

All non-slot nodes have a type and are linked to a subset of slots.
The linkage is stored in the `oslots` feature, which is an edge feature: it specifies a edges between
each non-slot nodes and the slots that belong to them.
This feature is hardly ever used directly, because the Text-Fabric API has functions to
move from containers to containees, the so-called
[locality](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/core/locality.html#tf.core.locality.Locality)
functions.

### Hierarchy

In the Text-Fabric the embeddedness of the nodes
is completely clear, and while that is not exactly the same as the tree-relation in XML,
it is sufficient, because the TEI elements encode merely a rather shallow sectional hierarchy
and not a deep linguistic hierarchy.

Should there arise the need for encoding hierarchy precisely, we can introduce other edge features
to encode the parent-child relation of the trees in question.

### Sections

Some of the node types correspond to sections, and Text-Fabric has some support for sections.

There are rigid sections in three levels: `volume`, `page`, `line`.

And there are more flexible structural sections, also three levels: `volume`, `letter`, `para`.

### node type `word` (slot type)

These are the words of the corpus, the basic units.

The text, without punctuation is stored word by word on slots, in the feature `trans`.
All punctuation, including spaces, is stored on the slot of the preceding word,
in the feature `punc`.

White-space will be normalized to single spaces or newlines.
Only the original letter contents and the editorial remarks are stored word by word.
The footnotes are stored one by one, as values of the feature `fnote`, see below.

Next to the `trans` and `punc` features, there are the `transo`, `punco` and `transr`, `puncr` 
feature pairs. They contain the same information as `trans` and `punc`, but only for those words
that are original text resp. editorial text, and they are empty outside their textual scope.

The dataset defines text formats (in the `otext` feature) that make use of these features:

```
@fmt:text-orig-full={trans}{punc}
@fmt:text-orig-remark={transr}{puncr}
@fmt:text-orig-source={transo}{punco}
```

By choosing a text format you can selectively show original text only, editorial text only,
or all text.

**Note**
Folio references also show up when selecting editorial text.

When words have received special formatting, it is stored in flag features.
These features have the value 1 if the word has that formatting, and are undefined for words
not having the feature.

All **word** features:

feature | type | description
--- | --- | ---
`emph` | 1 or absent | whether the word is set in emphatic typography
`fnote` | string | footnotes associated with this word, including their marks, separated by double new lines if their are multiple ones
`folio` | 1 or absent | whether the word is part of a folio reference
`punc` | string | punctuation and or white space after the word
`punco` | string | as `punc`, but only for original letter content
`puncr` | string | as `punc`, but only for editorial content
`ref` | 1 or absent | whether the word belongs to a reference
`remark` | 1 or absent | whether the word belongs to editorial content
`sub` | 1 or absent | whether the word is in subscript, possibly the numerator of a fraction
`super` | 1 or absent | whether the word is in superscript, possibly the numerator of a fraction
`special` | 1 or absent | whether the word has special typography or a strange value (possibly OCR effects)
`trans` | string | the value of the word
`transo` | string | as `trans`, but only for original letter content
`transr` | string | as `trans`, but only for editorial content
`und` | 1 or absent | whether the word is underlined, possibly the total amount in a calculation
